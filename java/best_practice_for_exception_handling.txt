Some best practices for exception handling in java programming.

# Never swallow the exception in try catch.

    catch (NoSuchMethodException e) {
        return null;
    }

# Declare the specific checked exceptions that your method can throw.

    // Incorrect way
    public void foo() throws Exception {}

    // Correct way
    public void foo() throws SpecificException1, SpecificException2 {}

# Do not catch Exception class rather catch specific sub classes.

    // Incorrect way

    try {
        someMethod();
    } catch (Exception e) {
        LOGGER.error("failed!", e);
    }

# Never catch Throwable class.

# Always correctly wrap the exceptions in custom exceptions so that stack
  trace is not lost.

    // Incorrect way
    catch (NoSuchMethodException e) {
        throw new MyException("error message!" + e.getMessage());
    }

    // Correct way
    catch (NoSuchMethodException e) {
        throw new MyException("error message!", e);
    }

# Either log the exception or throw it but never do both.

    // Incorrect way
    catch (NoSuchMethodException e) {
        logger.error("error message", e);
        throw e;
    }

# Never throw any exception from finally block.

    try {
        someMethod();
    } finally {
        cleanUp();      // make sure clearUp method never throw exceptions.
    }

# Don't use printStackTrace() statement or similar methods

# Use finally blocks instead of catch blocks if you are not going to handle
  exception.

    try {
        someMethod();
    } finally {
        cleanUp();
    }

# Always remember "Throw early catch late" principle

# Always clean up resources after handling the exception.

# Throw only relevant exception from a method.

# Never use exceptions for flow control in you program

# Validate use input to catch adverse conditions very early in request
  processing.

# Pass all relevant information to exceptions to make them informative as much
  as possible

# Always terminate the thread which it is terminated

# Use template methods for repeated try-catch

# Document all exceptions in your application in Javadoc
