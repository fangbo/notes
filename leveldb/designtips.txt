# Global Configuration

    Every software has its only configuration. In leveldb, the configuration is
    implemented by Options. The options is taken as constructor method parameter
    for many Objects, such as TableBuilder, BlockBuilder.

    Hadoop has the same design strategy. The class Configurations in Hadoop holds
    the global configurations and many classes use this Configurations instance.
