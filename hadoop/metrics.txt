# Metrics is important

For a distributed system, a clear and accurate metrics system is essential.
The metrics system provides the detail information about the system including
of performance, counters and errors.

Hadoop designs a clear metrics framework. Numerous counters are collected by
this metrics framework, and these data provide details for us to observe the
running system.


# Architecture and Principles

Metrics system provides abstract interface and data type.  The main principle
is that data is collected, stored and exported by framework.  Client is
responsible for providing and updating the specific metric data.

MetricsRecord and Updater take as bridge between client and framework.
Normally, client create a MetricsRecord instance by invoking the method
MetricsContext.createRecord and is referenced by client. Client must build a
class which is the implementation of The interface Updater.This Updater object
should be registed to MetricsContext by calling MetricsContext.registUpdater.
In method doUpdate(), client has the opportunity to update the metrics values.

MetricsContext creates and manages a Timer which invokes all the
Updater.doUpdate at regular time intervals.


# Main Interfaces

* MetricsContext

    MetricsContext defines main interface of the metrics framework.

    // Create a new MetricsRecord with the given recordName
    // Client should use the method to create its own MetricsRecord

    MetricsRecord createRecord(String recordName)

    // Register a callback to be called at regular time intervals.

    void registerUpdater(Updater updater)

* ContextFactory

    ContextFactory is responsible to create a MetricsContext object. All the
    MetricsContext objects are stored in the field #contextMap#.

    ContextFactory is singleton and the static method getFactory returns the
    only ContextFactory's instance.

* Updater

    Updater is a interface and defines only one method #doUpdate(MetricsContext)#.
    Client's specific Updater implementation is registered in MetricsContext.
    doUpdate is the callback method for MetricsContext.

* MetricsRecord
