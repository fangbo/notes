DO

    Ask for clarification on a problem if you didn't understand something or
    if there is any ambiguity.

    Let the interviewer know what you are thinking.

    Suggest mulitple approaches to the problem.

    Bounce ideas off the interviewer (such as ideas for data structures or algorithms).

    If you get stuck, don't be afraid to let them know and politely ask for a hint.


DON'T

    Never give up! This says nothing good about your problem solving skills.

    Don't just sit in silence while thinking. The interviewer has limited time to
    find out as much as possible about you, and not talking with them tell them
    nothing, except that you can sit there silently.

    If you already know the answer, don't just blurt it out! They will suspect that
    you already knew the answer and did't tell them you have seen the question before.
    At least pretend to be thinking though the problem before you give the answer!
