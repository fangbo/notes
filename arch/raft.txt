Raft is a consensuus algorithm for managing a replicated log.  It produces a
result equivalent to (multi-)Paxos, and it is as efficient as Paxos. Raft is
more understandable than Paxos and provides a better foundation for building
practical systems.

Raft seperates the key elements of consensus, such as leader election, log
replication, and safety, and it enforces a stronger degree of coherency to
reduce the number of state that must be considered.


# Novel Features

    * Strong leader

    A stronger form of leadership than other consensus algorithms is used in Raft.
    For example,  log entries only flow from the leader to other servers.

    * Leader election

    Raft uses a randomized timers to select leaders. This add only a small amount of
    mechanism to the heartbeats already required for any consensus algorithm, while
    resolving conflicts simply and rapidly.

    * Membership changes

    Raft uses a new *joint consensus* approach for changing the set of servers in
    the cluster. This allows the cluster to continue operating normally during
    configuration changes.


# Replicated state machines

Consensus algorithms typically arise in the context of replicated state
machine.  State machines on a collection of servers compute identical copies of
the same state and can continue operating even if some of the servers are down.
The consensus alogrithm manages a replicated log containing state machine
commands from clients. The state machines process identical sequences of
commands from the logs, so they produce the same outputs.

    * The ensure safety under all non-Byzantine conditions, including network
      delays, partitions, and package loss, duplication and reordering.

    * They are fully available as long as any majority of the servers are
      operational and can comminuate with each other and with clients.

    * They do not depend on timing to ensure the consistency of the logs:
      faulty clocks and extreme message delays can, at worst, cause availability
      problems.

    * A command can complete as soon as a majority of the cluster has repsond
      to a single round of remote procedure calls; a minority of slow servers
      need not impact overall system performance.


# Paxos's Drawbacks

    * Paxos is exceptionally difficult to understand.

    * Paxos does not provide a good foundation for building practical
      implementations.
