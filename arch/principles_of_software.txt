What is software engineering

    Software engineering is the construction of software that produces some
    desired output for some range of inputs.


Input of Software

    * The hardware on which software is running.

    * The rate at which it receives data.

    * Anything else that influences the operation of the software.


Sources of uncertainty in software

    * We don't know how to make perfect software: bugs can and will be deployed
      to production.

    * Humans are involed in running software in production. Humans make
      mistakes.

    * What functionality youre software should have very rarely are the specs
      fully understood and fleshed out from the let go.

    * The uncertainlity in all dependencies you are using.

    * Not understanding the range of inputs your software will see in
      production.


Engineering for uncertainlity

    * Minimize dependencies

    * Lessen probalities of cascading failures

    * Mesure and monitor

    Software should be designed from the start to be monitored. Monitor aspects of
    software should be taken considered as important as the functionality of the software
    itself. Everything should be measured ---- latencies, throughput stats, buffer sizes
    and anything else relevant to the application.
