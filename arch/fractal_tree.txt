Storage System

    Hard disks are slow for random I/O, fast for sequential I/O

    SSDs are fast for random I/O, but expensive for sequential


BTree

    Data structure invented in 1972

    Not keep up with hardware trends

    Every insertion needs a random I/O

    Internal node stores just pivots and pointers for each child.


Fractal Tree

    Scales with hardware

    Fast indexing, More indexing, Faster queries

    Great Compression

    No Fragmentation

    Reduced wear on SSDs

    Internal node stores pivots, pointers, BUFFERs for each child.

    Buffer is used to batch up write operations.
